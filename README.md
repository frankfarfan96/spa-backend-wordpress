# SPA-backend-wordpress
## In this repo, I recreat an SPA that consumes the data of the information of blogs made by wordpress. 
In my case I consumed the CSS-TRICKS site (you can change the blog by changing the ENDPOINT found in the wp_api.js folder).
The header has 3 sections and 2 links, in the first section I have implemented a home page with infinite scroll where it shows from the latest articles that came out to the oldest (thanks to the infinite scroll).
The second is a search section, where you can search for articles filtered by a word and it also presents infinite scroll and the third one with a working form made thanks to the formatSubmit api.
Of the links, the first one sends to the official site of the blog from which we consume the data and the other to an online course free where I learned and improve my skills in the world of JS.
